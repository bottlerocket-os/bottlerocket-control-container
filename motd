This container gives you access to the Bottlerocket API, which in turn lets you
inspect and configure the system.  You'll probably want to use the `apiclient`
tool for that; for example, to inspect the system:

   apiclient -u /settings

You can run `apiclient --help` for usage details, and check the main
Bottlerocket documentation for descriptions of all settings and examples of
changing them.

If you need to debug the system further, you can enable the admin container.
This enables SSH access to the system using the key you specified when you
launched the instance.  This environment has more debugging tools installed,
and allows you to get root access to the host.

To enable the admin container, run:

   enable-admin-container
